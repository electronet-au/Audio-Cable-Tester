# Cable Tester
Inspired by [brodafins](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWdkH3cT7uKhssbFg7uHtw) cable tester I decided to add my own twist to it and make a modified version.

If you would like to check out the original project you should watch his [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3Qzw2hiL2Y) and see how he built his unit.
His code can be found in the [Instired by Brodafin](Audio-Cable-Tester/blob/main/Instired%20by%20Brodafin/brodafin.ino) folder of this repository.


Besides XLR and 1/4" cables It also test SpeakOn (PA speaker) Cables.
The option to test those cables is limited to the (NL2 and NL4 only) in this version but may be expanded if there is enough interest to the project.
